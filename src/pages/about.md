/dev/parent is a blog that aims to be entertaining and useful for tech folks with kids. The shape of my side projects certainly changed when I had my first kid, and I'm sure yours have too. Whether it's setting up overly complicated VPN networks so everyone can access your homelab, or just trying to get notifications working correctly for a new project, we hope we have something for you.
