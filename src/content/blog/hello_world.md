## So what is /dev/parent all about?

We all know that tech is increasingly becoming a core part of our and our children’s lives. As parents we need to figure out how and when to introduce tech to the kiddos, and we also need to find ways that tech can make our lives easier. This blog may or may not actually help answer these questions!

I don’t consider myself an expert on parenting (or tech!) so I probably won’t be handing out sage advice that will magically make everything perfect; however, I do have a few years of experience in both areas so I’m not _completely_ unqualified. I mainly aim to write a few things that may be useful and/or entertaining for tech parents.

That said, hopefully some posts are interesting for people without kids, or for people that aren’t into tech!

## Content

I expect this blog and its content will change over time. Everything will remain at least tangentially related to parenting and tech! Currently, I have a backlog of fun topics and projects that I’d like to write about so the first few posts will range from how-tos to simple overviews of random tinkerings and side projects.

I also have no idea what the posting cadence will be. Maybe once a week, maybe more, maybe less. We’ll see!

If you have any idea for topics you’d like me to write about, feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:hello@devslashparent.com).

Hope you like it here!
